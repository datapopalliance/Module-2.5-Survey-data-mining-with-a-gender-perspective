Frequenty Asked Questions (FAQs),
How are the country-level statistics calculated?,"The country- level statistics provided reflect the percentage of respondents in each country/region providing a given response to each question. These percentages are calculated based on all people who responded to a given question (even if their response is ""Don't Know"" or ""Prefer not to respond""). These percentages are then calibrated to provide estimates representing the online population in each country and then disaggregated for men and women, shedding light on gender differences within countries and regions.Weights were applied at the individual respondent level before aggregation. Visit the website to learn more about the methodology (see link above)."
How should I interpret the values?,"Unless otherwise indicated in the Codebook, a value is the percent of all respondents of that gender who responded to that specific variable. For instance, a value of ""56"" for variable ""a1_neutral"" for gender ""Female"" means that 56% of all females who answered question A1 responded ""neutral"".

The codebook indicates exceptions, which are usually done to enable sharing of data where individual response counts are too low to preserve privacy."
Why aren't all countries included?,"The survey was not administered in every country in the world. (For a list of countries included, visit the website to learn more about the methodology (see link above).) Additionally, to preserve privacy, responses from countries where response rates were insufficient for country-level representation have been aggregated into a ""Rest of region"" group for their geographic region. This dataset thus includes data for 116 countries, territories, or islands across seven world regions, using the World Bank classification of countries by region."
Why arenâ€™t statistics provided for every response option for each question?,"This country-level dataset provides statistics that are consistent with those used to write the public report (see link above). In general, the following parameters inform what data is and is not included:
- We aimed to cover as many variables and response categories as possible within a concise, useful data file. This necessitated excluding some questions that are difficult to interpret or are of limited relevance as country-level aggregate statistics.
- For a few of the multiple-choice questions, we collapse multiple answers following the same logic used for the public report. (See the ""Notes"" column in the Codebook for details when this is the case). 
- The statistic for some response options may be blank for some countries where an insufficient number of people responded to ensure representativeness and anonymity.
These decisions serve to keep a balance between providing useful data and maintaining a manageable dataset (if data were provided for every response option, the dataset would contain hundreds of variables, and many of these would have blank values)."
"The survey included an ""Optional"" section. Where is that data?","In general, respondents were allowed to skip any question(s) they did not want to answer. Due to the nature of online surveys and length of questionnaire, response rates for this section were too low to warrant including in this dataset."
The survey include open-ended questions. Where are those responses?,Responses to open-ended questions are not included in this dataset to ensure respondents' privacy.
Is this data statistically representative of the populations of these countries?,"No. Weights were applied to ensure this data is representative of the online population of the country, but not the total (online and offline) population. Please be mindful of this limitation when conducting your analysis. We have included an estimate of Internet penetration for each country (this estimate is from the UN and not produced by Facebook) to give users a sense of the population that responses from each country represents."
Can I access the raw survey data?,"De-identified, record-level response data to most questions (this is different from ""raw"" survey data) may be available to eligible non-profit organizations for research purposes. Please email gendersurvey@fb.com if you are interested in learning more."
"Does this data include the same questions and response options as the Regional aggregate dataset, which is also available on the Humanitarian Data Exchange?",The questions and response options in the two datasets are parallel with one small exception: Response options for two questions (C.1. and B.6. - see Codebook) are not available at the country level due to low response rates.
